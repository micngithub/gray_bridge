This is a personal portfolio project.

I am taking pictures as a hobby. I move the photos from dslr to ipad and edit them. Sadly, the capacity of the ipad is limited, so I have to periodically transfer photos from the ipad to nas. This project aims to create a program that reads EXIF information when an ipad is connected to a pc or mac, creates a folder by time or place, and stores it in nas.

It was written inefficiently because it was a portfolio project.
I have 2 UI projects and 2 library projects in one repository. I'm configuring my UI project with Qt/Qml and my library with cmake project. I chose this absurd structure to show that both can be used.

Caution :
- Because it is a personal project, it does not have general purpose.
- Because it is a personal project, we do not accept requests.
- Since this is a personal project, you can freely use the code.
